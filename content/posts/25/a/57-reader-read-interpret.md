+ Science is often hard to read and most people assume that its difficulties are born out of necessity, out of the extreme complexity of scientific concepts, data and analysis.
+ Readers do not simply read but they interpret, then any piece of prose, no matter how short, may "mean" in 10 (or more) different ways to 10 different readers.
+ They make many of their most important interpretive decisions about the substance of prose based on clues from its structure.
