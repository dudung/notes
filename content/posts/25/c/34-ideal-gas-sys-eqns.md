Equations used in an ideal gas system are listed here, but they might be not complete.


## equation of state
Ideal gas obeys equation of state

$$\tag{1}
PV = nRT,
$$

known as the ideal gas law [^britannica_2025], with $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles of gas, $R$ is universal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.


## isobaric process
An isobaric process is a thermodynamic process in which the pressure remains constant [^jones_2019], where the state variables are

$$\tag{2a}
P_j = P_i,
$$

$$\tag{2b}
V_j \ne V_i,
$$

$$\tag{2c}
T_j \ne T_i,
$$

in this process from state $i$ to state $j$.


## isochoric process
An isochoric process is a thermodynamic process during which the volume of the closed system undergoing such a process remains constant, that is exemplified by the heating or the cooling of the contents of a sealed, inelastic, undeformable container [^wikipedia_2024]. There state variables are

$$\tag{3a}
P_j \ne P_i,
$$

$$\tag{3b}
V_j = V_i,
$$

$$\tag{3c}
T_j \ne T_i,
$$

in this process from state $i$ to state $j$.


## specific heat ratio
It is an additional variable in ideal gas system [^hall_2021]

$$\tag{9}
\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v},
$$

where at different temperature different gas has different value[^knowino_2010].
