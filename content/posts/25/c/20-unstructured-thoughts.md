Following previous note [^viridi_2025] this note is written. When you, as a reader, land to this writing, think twice to go futher. It might be not worth it to read. I already warn you, not to waste you precious time by reading this.


## phrase
The phrase unstructured thoughts is not unique since I have found some, at least as the title of posts [^nakade_2021] and [^madrburris_2025], title of a poem [^darkangelalliance_2016], and title of a blog [^hobin_2014].


## condition
It just crosses my mind since my brain seems full and can not think easily as it used to be. I have a feeling that there is something blocking it to prevent it being creative and flowing. It just like a dead end.

I am used to have new ideas easily then was able direclty to code them using JavaScript or Python. But now it feels like an old man that has to think over and over before can decide something. Am I getting old or what? I do not know.


## solution
A thinkable solution is writing the thoughts, even they are blocked, and let the fingers dance. Whatever they type, just save the result. And perhaps I have time to read it in the future, but when not it is you that the one who has chance. I am sorry to say that. If you find this point then you are a person that helps me to appreciate the unstructed thoughts of mine. I would like to thank you.


## closing
Well, it is 2237 and I do not have any idea what to write in this note. At least it is a-two-mins-read note. So, when you read it, there is not too mucht time that you will waste.
