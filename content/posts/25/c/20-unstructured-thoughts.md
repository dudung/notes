Following previous note [^viridi_2025] this note is written. When you, as a reader, land to this writing, think twice to go futher. It might be not worth it to read. I already warn you, not to waste you precious time by reading this.

## phrase
The phrase unstructured thoughts is not unique since I have found some, at least as the title of posts [^nakade_2021] and [^madrburris_2025], title of a poem [^darkangelalliance_2016], and title of a blog [^hobin_2014].


## reason
It just crosses my mind since my brain seems full and can not think easily as it used to be. I have a feeling that there is something blocking it to prevent it being creative and flowing. It just like a dead end.
