This year I obtain some research grant directly or indirectly and also in process of applying some. Seeing the situation a plan how to manamage them is required in order to not miss any. Especially, there are debts from a grant that is received in two successive years but the outputs are still rejected. A solid plan is need to manage on-going and new projects. The indirect and not-yet are also interesting and consume time. Without proper time management I can not imagine how to handle them in efficient way.


## loads
A simple model can be used to view loads due to the projects, e.g. for project $i$ the load is

$$\tag{1}
L_i = f_i(t_w, s_w, p_w, c_w, ..),
$$

where $t_w$ is for time allocation in a week, $s_w$ is for schedule in a week, $p_w$ is progress in a week, $c_w$ is communication in a week, and other factors. The allocation time and schedule are separated since it might be that a project requires e.g. weekly meeting but the other only monthly meeting, so that even the allocation time the same, but the load in each week due to different project is different.
