+ `01` Germination (0–7 days)
  - The seed absorbs water and begins sprouting.
  - The radicle (root) and plumule (shoot) emerge.
+ `02` Seedling Stage (7–21 days)
  - The first leaves appear, and roots develop.
  - The plant establishes itself in the soil.
+ `03` Tillering Stage (22–45 days)
  - The plant produces multiple stems (tillers).
  - More leaves and roots develop.
+ `04` Stem Elongation (45–60 days)
  - The plant grows taller, preparing for reproductive growth.
  - Nutrients and energy accumulate for panicle formation.
+ `05` Panicle Initiation (60–80 days)
  - The plant begins forming panicles inside the stem.
  - Leaves continue growing, but the focus shifts to reproduction.
+ `06` Booting Stage (80–90 days)
  - The panicle swells inside the leaf sheath.
  - The plant prepares for flowering.
+ `07` Heading Stage (90–100 days)
  - The panicle emerges from the leaf sheath.
  - The flowers (spikelets) are exposed.
+ `08` Flowering Stage (100–110 days)
  - The flowers bloom, pollinate, and begin forming grains.
  - This is a critical stage for yield.
+ `09` Milk Stage (110–120 days)
  - Developing grains contain a milky, liquid endosperm.
  - The plant remains green and actively transports nutrients.
+ `10` Dough Stage (120–130 days)
  - The grains thicken, with starch accumulation.
  - The plant begins to yellow as it nears maturity.
+ `11` Maturity Stage (130–150 days)
  - Grains harden and turn golden brown.
  - The plant is ready for harvest.
+ `12` Senescence & Death (After 150 days)
  - Leaves dry out, and the plant stops growing.
  - If unharvested, the plant dies naturally.
