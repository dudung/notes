This note is a continuation of previous idea [^viridi_2025], where part of its to-do list is further discussed. A class that can accomodate state, process, and cycle of ideal gas. Ideally, any cycles with infinite variations of states and processes can be supported. And from that the heat, work, and change of internal energy can be obtained. Before that, the table of states variable can also be calculated from uncomplete one. It might be sort of like a sudoku [^kaufman_2022].
