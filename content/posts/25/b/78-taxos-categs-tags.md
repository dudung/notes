+ There are two default taxonomies: categories and tags.
+ Categories are hierarchical and can have parent-child relationships, which are ideal for broad content groupings like subject or types.
+ Tags are non-hierarchical and offering a more granular way to describe content using keywords, e.g. a blog-type post on "Laptops" could have tags "Gaming", "Productivity", and "Budget-Friendly".
+ By implementing a clear hierarchy with categories and adding specific details through tags, a website can be transformed from a cluttered mess into a well-organized haven of information.
