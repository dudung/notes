+ A piecewise-constant acceleration is constant over extended time intervals and changing in value discontinuously from one interval to the next.
+ This is physically unrealistic in any real-life situation, since the acceleration would be expected to change more or less smoothly from instant to instant.
+ In realistic models of collisions the acceleration changes smoothly, but it still can be approximated as continuous for simplification.
