<!--more-->

+ From the day that you completed undergraduate training and decided to become a researcher, your circle of colleagues changed.
+ It expanded from being a relatively few fellow students to an indefinite number of fellow researchers from all over the world.
+ Communicating with them is a very different task from the one you were involved in as a student.
+ In fact, you may have to spend as much time writing, reading or correcting manuscripts as you do on research itself.
