+ Scientific papers have a stereotyped format, where it usually consists of Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References.
+ The exact section headings sometimes may vary, but looks the same.
+ The predictable form and standard order ensure that a reader knows what to expect.
